# Femto Theme for Typesetter CMS #

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## About ##

Femto is an extremely lean and fast-loading (non-Bootstrap) theme for Typesetter CMS (~10kB of code in total) featuring an off-canvas &lsquo;togglable&rsquo; side navigation. Don&rsquo;t expect too much pre-defined style &ndash; this one is a barebone. Build upon it if you like simple things.
